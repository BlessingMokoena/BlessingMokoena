## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Blessing, a student aspiring to become a full-stack web developer. Currently, I am focusing on front-end development, where I am building my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also have a limited knowledge of Python and Java, which I plan to expand as I progress in my studies.

## Learning Goals
### Front-End Development:
I aim to become proficient in front-end technologies, including advanced JavaScript frameworks like React or Vue.js, within the next year.
I want to deepen my understanding of user interface design and user experience principles to create visually appealing and user-friendly websites.

### Back-End Development:
As I gain confidence in front-end development, I plan to start learning back-end technologies, including Python (with frameworks like Flask or Django) and Java (with Spring).
I also intend to explore databases such as MySQL or MongoDB to understand how to manage data effectively.

## Current Skills
HTML: Proficient in creating structured web pages.

CSS: Knowledgeable in styling web pages and creating responsive designs.

JavaScript: Familiar with core concepts and basic DOM manipulation.

Python: Limited knowledge, primarily focused on basic syntax and concepts.

Java: Limited knowledge, with an understanding of basic programming principles.

## Resources
To aid in my learning journey, I utilize the following resources:

W3Schools: For tutorials and references on web technologies.

Codecademy: For interactive coding exercises and structured learning paths.

freeCodeCamp: For a comprehensive curriculum that covers both front-end and back-end development.

YouTube: For video tutorials and explanations on various programming topics.

MDN Web Docs: For in-depth documentation on web standards and best practices.

## Future Plans
### Full-Stack Development:
My ultimate goal is to become a full-stack developer, capable of building complete web applications from the ground up.

### Career Aspirations:
I hope to work on real-world projects, either through internships or freelance opportunities, to gain practical experience and enhance my portfolio.

I am excited about the journey ahead and committed to continuous learning and improvement in my programming skills. I look forward to applying my knowledge in both personal projects and professional endeavors.
